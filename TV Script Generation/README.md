# **TV script generation using LSTM**

### **Project 3: Recurrent Neural Network for TV Script generation**

In this project we had to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and use it to generate a new Simpsons TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The project was written in Python (on a Jupyter Notebook) using the libraries numpy and tensorflow, running on an Anaconda environment.
