# **Language translation using LSTM**

### **Project 4**
Using a sequence to sequence RNN model to translate sentences from English to French. The dataset is text files of ~140,000 fairly simple sentences in English and in French.

This is Project 4 of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation. The aim of the project is to go through the process of implementing a sequence to sequence model in TensorFlow by building the encoder and decoder architectures, and finally be able to translate simple English sentences to French.
