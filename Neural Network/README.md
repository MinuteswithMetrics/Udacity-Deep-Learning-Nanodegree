# **Simple neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership**

### **First Neural Network**

This is a project from Udacity's Deep Learning course. Here we take bike rental data and feed it through our neural network to predict bike sharing rides.

Graphs!

Some graphs of the outcomes. I found that 5000 epochs and 7 hidden nodes worked well for training.
