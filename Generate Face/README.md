# Face Generation 

### Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation from Udacity

**Project 5**

In this project we had to build a Generative Adversarial Network that can generate novel faces when trained on the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA). The project was written in Python (on a Jupyter Notebook) using the libraries numpy, matplotlib, glob and tensorflow, running on an Anaconda environment.

**Topics covered**

* Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
* Deep Convolutional GANs
