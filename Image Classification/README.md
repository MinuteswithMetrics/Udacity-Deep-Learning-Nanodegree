# Project 2 - Image classification on CIFAR-10 data set using CNN

## Introduction
Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.

## Rubric

### Required Files and Tests
1.) Have all project files been included with the submission?
2.) Have all the unit tests in the project passed?

### Preprocessing
1.) Does the normalize function correctly normalize image data?
2.) Does the project create one or more convolutional and max pooling layers without using contrib functions?
3.) Does the project create a flatten layer?
4.) Does the project create one or more fully connect layers?
5.) Does the project create a output layer?

### Neural Network Architecture
1.) Does the project create a convolutional model that predicts on the data?

### Neural Network Training
1.) Does the neural network optimize correctly?
2.) Does the project print loss and validation accuracy?
3.) Does the project use reasonable hyperparameters?
4.) Does the neural network achieve a good accuracy for the methods available?
