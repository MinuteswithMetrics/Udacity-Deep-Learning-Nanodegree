- ###  Udacity Deep Learning Nanaodegree Foundation  below:
	
	- [Neural Network](https://github.com/MinuteswithMetrics/DLNF_First-Neural-Network/blob/master/Your%2Bfirst%2Bneural%2Bnetwork.ipynb): Develop a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership

	- [Image Classification](https://github.com/MinuteswithMetrics/DLNF-Image-Classification/blob/master/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb): This project use CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
	
	- [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/MinuteswithMetrics/DNLF_Generate_TV_Scripts/blob/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb): This project objective to use to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and use it to generate a new Simpsons TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The project was written in Python (on a Jupyter Notebook) using the libraries numpy and tensorflow, running on an Anaconda environment.	

	- [Language Translation](https://github.com/MinuteswithMetrics/DLNF_Language_Translation/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb): Using a sequence to sequence RNN model to translate sentences from English to French. The dataset is text files of ~140,000 fairly simple sentences in English and in French.
	
	- [Generate Face](https://github.com/MinuteswithMetrics/DLNF_Face_Generation/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb):  Used a generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
